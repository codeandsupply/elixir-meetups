# TDD in Elixir

When starting with Elixir, one of the first things I had hoped to find was good
ways to do Test Driven Development. This example app shows how to do TDD in
Elixir!

Elixir is a very young language so some of the tools just you can find in
languages like Ruby just aren't there yet.

What do I expect to find in Ruby?

- Unit testing with assertions
- Acceptance/integration testing
- Easy fixtures or factories
- Mocking and stubbing

What from that list do I get in Elixir?

- Unit testing with assertions ‚úîÔ∏é [ExUnit](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/ex_unit/1.html)
- Acceptance/integration testing ‚úîÔ∏é [Hound](https://github.com/HashNuke/hound)
- Easy fixtures or factories ùòü couldn't find anything
- Mocking and stubbing ‚úîÔ∏é https://github.com/jjh42/mock

## Easy Fixtures or Factories

Elixir's big conference is named Elixir Factory. SEO fail :(

@justinxreese I would reach for simple functions in these cases, ie
create_admin(name: ‚ÄúJustin‚Äù‚Ä¶) => %User{name: ‚ÄúJustin‚Äù, role: :admin}.

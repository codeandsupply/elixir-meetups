# TDD in Elixir

When starting with Elixir, one of the first things I had hoped to find was good
ways to do Test Driven Development. This example app shows how to do TDD in
Elixir!

Elixir is a very young language so some of the tools just you can find in
languages like Ruby just aren't there yet.

What do I expect to find in Ruby?

- Unit testing with assertions
- Acceptance/integration testing
- Easy fixtures or factories
- Mocking and stubbing
- QuickCheck

What from that list do I get in Elixir?

- Unit testing with assertions ‚úîÔ∏é [ExUnit](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/ex_unit/1.html)
- Acceptance/integration testing ‚úîÔ∏é [Hound](https://github.com/HashNuke/hound)
- Easy fixtures or factories ùòü couldn't find anything
- Mocking and stubbing ‚úîÔ∏é https://github.com/jjh42/mock
- QuickCheck ‚úîÔ∏é https://github.com/manopapad/proper

## Installing Testing Dependencies

In mix.exs, there is a place for dependencies.

````
defp deps do
  # [ {:mock, '> 0.13', git: 'https://github.com/jjh42/mock.git'} ]
end
````

Once your dependency is added, run `mix deps.get`

Then you should be able to `import Mock` in your text files where necessary.

````
defmodule GreetingTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  import Mock
end
````

## Unit testing with assertions ‚úîÔ∏é

[ExUnit](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/ex_unit/1.html)

Built right in with Elixir, only need to do `use ExUnit.Case` in a module. Then
have assertions and named tests ready to use.

````
  test "Saying hello" do
    assert Greeting.hello("Ben") == "Hello, Ben!"
  end
````

Out of the box, ExUnit comes with asynchronous tests. Only need to add an
argument. `use ExUnit.Case, async: true`

## Easy Fixtures or Factories

Elixir's big conference is named Elixir Factory. SEO fail :(

````
@justinxreese I would reach for simple functions in these cases, ie
create_admin(name: ‚ÄúJustin‚Äù‚Ä¶) => %User{name: ‚ÄúJustin‚Äù, role: :admin}.
